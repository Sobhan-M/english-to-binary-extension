# Text To Binary Convertor

## Description

An extension that you can use to turn text into binary. The program takes each character’s UNICODE value and converts it into binary. It’s a very simple and neat program packed into an extension.

## Inspiration

I often use online English to binary converters when talking to friends — as part of an inside joke. All the converters I’ve used have had three major issues.

1. **Unintuitive Design:** Some websites required you to manually press a button after writing the text — as opposed to converting as you typed. Others placed reset buttons within the text field itself, making it common to lose everything you wrote.

2. **Lack Of Language Support:** Another issue is that these converters only support English. They lack support for many non-Latin languages, which makes it unusable to most of the world. They also lack support for emojis.

3. **Online Only:** These converters need a constant internet connection, despite the software and ideas behind it being simple.

This extension aims to solve all these issues and to provide a quick and easy way of converting between regular text and binary for all your geeky needs.

## Licensing

This extension uses the MIT license. It’s too simple and useless to bother putting any restrictions on. Do whatever you want.

## Download
